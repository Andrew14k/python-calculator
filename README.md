Calculator - backend and frontend

This is not a full-stack development. A calculator program was built in Python and then independently built using JavaScript, as this approach was seemingly easier and more efficient.

Utilities used:
Python - Backend development
Node.js, React - Framework for front-end
HTML, JavaScript - Frontend development
CSS - Interface design
GitHub - Version Control
Visual Studio Code - Project management and development

This program was completed over a couple days - but uploaded to GitHub including the branches at a later stage, due to transitioning GitHub accounts. Branches are displayed accurately.
